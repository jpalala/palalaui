## Inspiration / Motivation

I really like the idea behind [Capgemini DCX library](https://6069a6f47f4b9f002171f8e1-ihpxseoaag.chromatic.com/?path=/story/dcxlibrary-introduction--page) where the barebone implementation of
the UI was included before it gets styled. 

One of my favorite "barely styled" websites, [pinboard.in](https://pinboard.in), used for storing bookmarks and some of my notes.

While I like storybook, I wanted to keep my own DSS as minimalistic as possible without too much need to install some npm package. 

Basically the idea is one big README file with the designs and then some &lt;<pre>pre</pre>&gt; code attached to each component. Maybe i'll look into mdx, but for now let's try this!
